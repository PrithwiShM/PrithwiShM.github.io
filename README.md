# About Me

## Professional Background

I am currently working at First Citizens Bank under Dr. Cagatay Karan, focusing on robust risk measurement and model risk. My work involves applying advanced data structures and algorithms to solve complex financial problems.

## Academic Interests

I have a deep interest in efficient data structures and algorithms, particularly in maintaining and retrieving key-value pairs in a priority queue or min-heap form. My academic projects reflect this passion and my continuous drive to push the boundaries of what's possible with data.

## Current Projects

I am currently expanding my expertise in QuantRocket, specifically working on the S&P 500 constituents and moving towards live trading using PyAlgoTrade. My goal is to integrate machine learning into these strategies to enhance their predictive power.

## Personal Insights

My approach to problem-solving is deeply analytical, often combining theoretical knowledge with practical applications. I enjoy breaking down complex problems into manageable tasks and finding elegant, efficient solutions.
