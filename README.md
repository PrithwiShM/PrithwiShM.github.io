## Welcome to Prithwish Maiti's Portfolio
I am a passionate data scientist with a focus on disecting complexes financial assets and leveraging the power of data to find profitable trends in them. Currently, I'm working on expanding my expertise in quantitative trading and exploring the intersection of data science and finance.

## Professional Background

Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in financial mathematics at NC State University. I chose this path because I felt limited by having only mathematical and coding knowledge of data models. The financial industry has always been on my radar, and I want to work at the intersection of business and technology—a role well-suited for a financial/quantitative modeler.

In the summer of 2024, I worked on robust risk measurement and model risk. This experience provided me with valuable insights into evaluating risk in a Commercial banking setting. I have a keen interest in extracting patterns out of financial data mostly in the form of time series data. Previous to coming here I did an internship in a market making company where I was involved in creating a time-based alternative evolution of Limit-order book using the subscriber-publisher C++ framework. This was the time where I learned deeply about algorithmic trading and market making.

I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, one of India's premier technological institutes. After graduating, I worked as a data scientist at Hilabs, a health data analytics company.

## Academic Interests

My current focus is on leveraging the power of large data sets to build statistical models for low-risk investing, such as statistical arbitrage. Additionally, I am interested in using computational power to achieve results in stochastic processes that were previously unattainable, such as pricing options. The courses in my financial mathematics program have provided me with the ideal launchpad for this work.

I have a deep interest in efficient data structures and algorithms. I frequently engaged in coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, CodeChef, and Codeforces, which I found to be a fun pastime. During my undergraduate studies in mathematics, I took courses in algebra, probability, PDE, ODE, and discrete mathematics in the first two years, before shifting my focus to data science, including a course in deep learning. My academic projects reflect my passion for pushing the boundaries of what's possible with data.

## Personal Insights

My approach to problem-solving is deeply analytical, combining theoretical knowledge with practical applications. I enjoy breaking down complex problems into manageable tasks and finding elegant, efficient solutions.

Learning finance has transformed my perspective. Through the financial mathematics course during my bachelor's program, I became fascinated by the mechanics of money and its true value. It gave me a deep, intuitive understanding, particularly in areas like options and futures pricing. With my additional knowledge of statistics and data science, I am positioning myself to become a quantitative financial analyst.

At IIT Delhi, I was surrounded by some of the best and brightest thinkers in the country, which fostered a competitive mindset in me. However, I also recognized that the education system often promotes exam-based learning, which can hinder a deeper understanding of subjects and contribute to a sense of a "rat race."

## Robust Risk Measurment and Worst Case Senarios

Financial risk measurement depends on models of prices and other market variables, but these models are inherently based on imperfect assumptions and estimates, leading to model risk. Optimization decisions, such as portfolio selection, exacerbate the impact of model error. In this study, we develop a framework to quantify the impact of model error and to measure and minimize risk in a manner that is robust to such errors. Our robust approach begins with a baseline model and identifies the worst-case error in risk measurement that could result from deviating from this baseline model, subject to a specific constraint on the plausibility of the deviation. By using relative entropy to constrain model distance, we can explicitly characterize worst-case model errors. This method goes beyond simply addressing errors in parameter estimates to consider errors in the underlying stochastic assumptions of the model, identifying the greatest vulnerabilities to error. We apply this robust framework to issues of portfolio risk measurement, credit risk, and delta hedging.

## Mortgage loans Servity Analysis

Fannie Mae single-family mortgage loans data contains a lot of information on the loans they have acquired. It includes a robust comprehension of the performance of the loans and any delinquency procedure if conducted. However much of the data is in crude form, that is reflectes only the procedure in which it was collected and compiled. There is a need to refine the data and extract useful features . Here I present the procedure , that I have formulated to do the same and them form a predictive model to form a LGD prediction table and subsequently a servity model. 

The challenge of the data set is that any losses appear in the very last row and not before that. So we cannot build continuous evaluation process, and resort to a prediction model. I have attached a report of the data with the prediction model to be updated later along with the Github repo.

## Algorithmic Trading Development

Currently, I'm working on deploying a systematic algorithmic trading strategy which mostly works on technical analysis. My main aim is to integrate data science logic to direct patterns using time series data into the trading strategies. 

I am researching On 3 python libraries backed Trader back testing and pyAlgotrade(currently archived, so will move on to basana). Out of these three I have made significant progress in the pyAlgotrade library. Please stay updated for upcoming results which I will post on my website and my github repository.

Check out my blog on comparison of 3 algorithmic trading framework available as a [python module](https://medium.com/@prithwish.maiti99/comparizion-of-algorithmic-trading-packages-in-python-6480eee90af8)

# Blog

## Technical Articles

- **[Using PyAlgoTrade for Effective Backtesting]:** A comprehensive guide on getting started with PyAlgoTrade, and exploring live trading scenarios. This project is currently in development and a Github repo link will be updated here in the future.
  
## Market making Insights

- **[Financial Microstructure of Market Making](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13TvgtS62n2cEsx_6c7OnSbYc9ufrgRwN/view):** This paper contains a review of the second chapter of the book, algorithmic and high frequency trading by Cartea, Jaimungal and Penelva. It talks about the three models that have been described in various sections of this chapter. I started writing this To bridge the gap between the auth And the mathematical derivation so that anyone can clearly connect them. I have also added all the derivations and corrected some minor mistakes.
