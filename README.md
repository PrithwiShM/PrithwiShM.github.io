## Welcome to Prithwish Maiti's Portfolio

**Welcome to my webpage.**
I work at the intersection of systems engineering and data engineering, applying analytics to enable machines to perform high-level tasks with the computing power available today. My experience spans domains such as embedded systems, financial services, and healthcare analytics, where I have developed a deep appreciation for the need to design robust, scalable systems capable of processing data at scale.
I have an interest in dissecting complexes financial assets and leveraging the power of data to find profitable trends in them. I am eager to deepen my expertise in modelling information flow and reinforcement learning. With the vast amount of data available in today's world, integrating data science models has become an essential factor for driving informed decision-making, optimizing processes, and unlocking new opportunities for innovation.

## Professional Summary

Currently, I am employed at Murano Technologies at Durham, NC. Here, I am working as a software systems engineer for handheldable devices .  Working here has gained my focus on low level programming in C++, taking maximum control of the program, modular and Object-oriented design. I have also learned essential skills like ownership of projects, effective reporting and documentation. I also goth the opportunity to research great innovations in the sector of communication, localization and positioning and Computer vision. All these research experience have made me product builder capable to   

In the summer of 2024, I worked on robust risk measurement and model risk. This experience provided me with valuable insights into evaluating risk in a Commercial banking setting. I have a keen interest in extracting patterns out of financial data mostly in the form of time series data. 

I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, one of India's premier technological institutes. After graduating, I worked as a data scientist at Hilabs, a health data analytics company. There I learned what big data has done to the data analytics community, designing framework to handle the data before learning from the data. I was coding data mining and validation algorithms in Scala and maintaining the framework to derive the results. 

I did an internship in a market making company where I was involved in creating a time-based alternative evolution of Limit-order book using the subscriber-publisher C++ framework. This was the time where I learned deeply about algorithmic trading and market making. After a year, I realised that Market making is a niche business where knowing your competitor’s strategy has a big advantage. I read some amount of market making theory during this time. During my time here, I got to interact with other quantitative researchers and got a rounded idea of the qualities a financial research needs to possess.

With my knowledge of statistics, data science, and programming, I am positioning myself to work at conjunction of quantitative financial analyst and developer.

## Research Interests

My current focus is on leveraging the power of large data sets to build statistical models for low-risk investment frameworks, such as statistical arbitrage. Additionally, I am interested in using computational power to achieve results in stochastic processes that were previously unattainable, such as pricing options. The courses in my financial mathematics program have provided me with the ideal launchpad for this work.
I have a deep interest in efficient data structures and algorithms. I frequently engaged in coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, CodeChef, and Codeforces, which I found to be a fun pastime. During my undergraduate studies in mathematics, I took courses in algebra, probability, PDE, ODE, and discrete mathematics in the first two years, before shifting my focus to data science, including a course in deep learning. My academic projects reflect my passion for pushing the boundaries of what's possible with data.

 I love developing alphas in my free time and post my research and result in github. But lately, I have not got the time to develop alphas, due to the full-time employment I am perusing. I feel that it the statistical quantitative part of a financial analysis that I enjoy the most.

## Personal Insights

My approach to problem-solving is deeply analytical, combining theoretical knowledge with practical applications. I enjoy breaking down complex problems into manageable tasks and finding elegant, efficient solutions.

Prior to joining Murano Corporation, I had no experience of system-level design or low level programming. I started from square zero and went on to master every service, API, and concept our software uses. This experience has given me the belief that that I can tackle any problem that I determine to tackle. I also learned to emphasis soft skills like ownership of project, quality of work and more generally being responsible, which has added to my personal development. I learned how to become a valuable member of an enterprise.

Learning finance has transformed my perspective. Through the financial mathematics course during my bachelor's program, I became fascinated by the mechanics of money and its true value. It gave me a deep, intuitive understanding, particularly in areas like options and futures pricing.  I have been in other industries, producing analytical results and software development but didn't feel the thrill of perusing quantitative research in financial Industry. But said that, a lot of the skills needed in those industries are transferable. Ultimately from my understanding, a person becomes valuable by developing niche skills and the ability to learn fast and accurately.

At IIT Delhi, I was surrounded by some of the best and brightest thinkers in the country, which fostered a competitive mindset in me. However, I also recognized that the education system often promotes evaluation-based learning, which can hinder a deeper understanding of subjects and contribute to a sense of a "rat race." I am fortunate that I navigated that phase of my life and had the privilege to be mentored by amazing well-wishers.

## Robust Risk Measurment and Worst Case Senarios

Financial risk measurement depends on models of prices and other market variables, but these models are inherently based on imperfect assumptions and estimates, leading to model risk. Optimization decisions, such as portfolio selection, exacerbate the impact of model error. In this study, we develop a framework to quantify the impact of model error and to measure and minimize risk in a manner that is robust to such errors. Our robust approach begins with a baseline model and identifies the worst-case error in risk measurement that could result from deviating from this baseline model, subject to a specific constraint on the plausibility of the deviation. By using relative entropy to constrain model distance, we can explicitly characterize worst-case model errors. This method goes beyond simply addressing errors in parameter estimates to consider errors in the underlying stochastic assumptions of the model, identifying the greatest vulnerabilities to error. We apply this robust framework to issues of portfolio risk measurement, credit risk, and delta hedging.

## Mortgage loans Severity Analysis

Fannie Mae single-family mortgage loans data contains a lot of information on the loans they have acquired. It includes a robust comprehension of the performance of the loans and any delinquency procedure if conducted. However much of the data is in crude form, that is reflects only the procedure in which it was collected and compiled. There is a need to refine the data and extract useful features. Here I present the procedure, that I have formulated to do the same and them form a predictive model to form a LGD prediction table and subsequently a severity model. 

This data set presents a challenge of developing a prediction model. I have attached a report of the data with the prediction model to be updated later along with the Github repo.

## Algorithmic Trading Development

Currently, I'm working on deploying a systematic algorithmic trading strategy which mostly works on technical analysis. My main aim is to integrate data science logic to direct patterns using time series data into the trading strategies. 

I am researching On 3 python libraries backed Trader back testing and pyAlgotrade(currently archived, so will move on to basana). Out of these three I have made significant progress in the pyAlgotrade library. Please stay updated for upcoming results which I will post on my website and my github repository.

## Market making Insights

- **[Financial Microstructure of Market Making](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13TvgtS62n2cEsx_6c7OnSbYc9ufrgRwN/view):** This paper contains a review of the second chapter of the book, algorithmic and high frequency trading by Cartea, Jaimungal and Penelva. It talks about the three models that have been described in various sections of this chapter. I started writing this to bridge the gap between the auth and the mathematical derivation so that anyone can clearly connect them. I have also added all the derivations and corrected some minor mistakes.

## Technical Articles

- **[Using PyAlgoTrade for Effective Backtesting]:** A comprehensive guide on getting started with PyAlgoTrade, and exploring live trading scenarios. This project is currently in development and a GitHub repo link will be updated here in the future.
